# EnigmaProj_Server
I am writing an enigma project that includes socket multi-client connection and a simulator. This is the server repository.

The server implements different kinds of encryption - HASH for databases and RSA for the connection with the clients.
the server handles multiple clients simultaneously (via socket) and therefore operates with threads.

This is my first project with Cryptography yet not my first experience with it. I find this topic fascinating and 
I sincerely hope I will have more opportunities to practice with is.
